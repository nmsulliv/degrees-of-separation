## Try It Out!
You can try it out here: **http://nmsulliv.pythonanywhere.com/degrees**
It might be slow at times because I only have a free account, so if the
page doesn't load, wait a bit and try again!

## Starter Code
Starter code can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/degrees/

## Special Thanks
I'd like to give a special thanks to @Collins1938 for giving me the idea to store the 
dictionaries in a separate file so I wouldn't have to proccess them every time the page loaded. The web app wouldn't be as fast without him!
